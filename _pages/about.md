The Prodigy "Interactive Personal Service" launched in 1988 as a joint venture between IBM and Sears, was rebranded as "Prodigy Classic" as the company transitioned to more standards-based Internet service, and was retired in 1999.

Prodigy Reloaded is a continuation of efforts of the Prodigy Presevation Project.  The Preservation Project seeks to preserve Prodigy Classic content by collecting artifacts, especially the cache files used by the Prodigy client which are then mined for the content within.  Prodigy Reloaded makes use of this discovered content to present an API compatible Prodigy Classic server to which the original client can connect.

To history of the Prodigy company is well described on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)).  To learn more about the project, news updates, and how to get involved, explore the links at the top of this page.
